# Pig-Game
Pig Dice Game created using Vanilla JavaScript as part of a complete Vanilla JS course on Udemy by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course)

# Rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their turn, or 'CURRENT', score.
- If the player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and all the points accumulated during their turn.
- If the player rolls two 1s (snake eyes), they lose their turn and lose all the points accumulated during the game. 
- The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that their 'CURRENT' score gets added to their overall score. After that, it's the next player's turn. 
- The first player to reach 100 points overall wins the game.
- Furthermore, players can choose to change the winning score via the input box labeled 'WIN SCORE'.
